# Lethal Company FOV Adjust
 
 If you want this to work you need to add references to `BepInEx.dll`, `0Harmony.dll`, `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `UnityEngine.dll`, `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`, `UnityEngine.UI.dll`, `Unity.InputSystem.dll`, and `Unity.TextMeshPro.dll`
 
 Obviously, they need to be from your Lethal Company directory.
